This is an assignment provided by De Montfort University for CTEC2906 Object-Oriented Development
to demonstrate student's ability to design and implement an OO system consisting of a set of Java
classes, using advanced libraries within the Java SDK.

In this assignment I have demonstrate the ability of second year computing students in De Montfort
University  to select their final year module options. There are compulsory modules tht must be
selected based on the course of study, and others that are only associated with certain courses.
Modules either run in term 1 or 2, or all year long (Development Porject).
